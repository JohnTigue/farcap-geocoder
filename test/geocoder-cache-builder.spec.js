/*
Actually, this is a geocoder-cache-builder.spec.js (yup, already changed that name)
a geocoder-cache-builder.js builds a cache; how the 
cache is used is a separate issue/concern. The cache could
be used in a node server (or other non-js server) or it could
be loaded as a single file by a client in browsers to 
pre-fetch a bunch of name-to-loc mappings. Calling it
a geocoder-precache-builder is wrong.

Combined with a browser storage persistence mechanism and 
a rate limiter, the OSM folks might very much like to 
promote it.

/** geocoder-cache-builder.spec.js is a command-line utility useful
  * during build and deploy.  
  *
  * It takes in data files containing geographical location names and
  * translates them to (latitude, longitude) coordinates by looking
  * them up in a geocoder. The resulting 3-tuple mappings are then
  * persisted somewhere and can subsequently be used to, say, load a
  * geocoder's cache with pre-fecthed information. Specifically this
  * is done in this project in order to pre-load caching-geocoder.js.
  *
  * The purpose is to avoid forcing, say, a SPA in a browser to slowly
  * go to a remote geocoder many times during start-up in order to do
  * the geocoding on all the data it will be rendering.
  *
  * For an explantion of of this fat-before()s BDD test coding style,
  * wherein much of the work is done in the before hooks rather than
  * the it()'s, see (spoiler: designing a FSA via Give-When-Then):
